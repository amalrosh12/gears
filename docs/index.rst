   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Gears's documentation!
=================================

Gears is a library to compile, concatenate and minify JavaScript and CSS
assets, highly inspired by Ruby's Sprockets_. It includes support for writing
scripts, styles and client templates using CoffeeScript_, Handlebars_, Stylus_,
Less_, SASS_ and SCSS_. New compilers can be also easily added.

There is also:

- django-gears_, an app for Django that integrates Gears with Django project;
- Flask-Gears_, an extension that integrates Gears with Flask application;
- gears-cli_, a command-line utility that compiles assets. It also can watch
  assets for changes and automaticaly re-compile them.
